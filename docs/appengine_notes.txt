no state or session, no access to the server's filesystem (except read contents of app dir)
30 second max request to response time, ideal < 1 sec

db indexes are automatically created for the queries used by the app
db update of a single entity occurs in a transaction
entity group: entities that will be updated together in the same transaction (need to tell the db so it can keep them on the same server)
db-operations are locking, and writing can fail due to optimistic concurrency

Services:
